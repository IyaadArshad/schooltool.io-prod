Probability theory
Randomness is a concept that permeates various aspects of our lives. From the roll of dice to the flip of a coin, the outcomes are unpredictable and often surprising. This unpredictability is what makes games of chance so intriguing and, at times, so frustrating.

Expectancy = Win Rate * AverageWin – Loss Rate * AverageLoss

American Roulette has 38 pockets (1-36, 0, 00)
(47.37%), -5.26$ per $100 bet

Roulette++ has 38 pockets (1-38, 0)
(48.65%), -2.70 per $100 bet
(+1.28%)(+2.56)

I use coin flips for many decisions in life, do you find that strange? Mabye a little odd,

Well I'm here to tell you that life can be that little bit more inspiring and magical with just that flip of a coin.

 from choosing subjects to settling arguments. 

I find it fascinating how randomness plays a role in our daily lives. 

Randomness adds an element of excitement and unpredictability to anything it's integrated with, don't you think so?

Let's take a look at some games, enjoyed across the world, where probability is involved to understand this concept better.

Let's do a thought experiment.

Let's say I have a coin, with a 60% probability of landing heads, and if it lands heads, you win $100, but if it lands tails, you lose $100.

Here's one luck theory formula:
Expectancy = Win Rate * AverageWin – Loss Rate * AverageLoss

So, using this formula, your expectancy over 100 attempts would be $2000.

Now if I flip a coin and it lands heads, the probability of that happening would be 1/2, right?

But the probability of landing heads **twice** in a row is 1/4, wouldn't that mean that tails now had a 3/4 chance of landing? 

Should you be more likely to lose now?

**Raise your hand if you think tails is more likely to land now.**

The answer is... not really, heads still has a 60% chance of landing.

Some people believe that just because the same outcome has occured multiple times in a row, the opposite outcome is more likely to happen next, or "due", as gamblers call it.

This is known as the gambler's fallacy.

The belief that past random events influence the probability of future ones is known as the gambler's fallacy.

The gambler's fallacy is a cognitive bias that can lead to poor decision-making in games of chance.

It's important to remember that each coin flip is an independent event, and the outcome of one flip does not affect the outcome of the next.

It's also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy, after a famous incident in a casino in Monte Carlo in 1913.

Guess how many times the ball landed on black in a row?

26 times in a row.

The odds of that happening are 1 in 67 million.

Gamblers lost millions that day (the casino made a fortune), believing that red was "due" to come up.

So that's pretty bad luck for those who lost.

But it's important to note that each time the odds were still constant, 48.75% for each color.

So to sum up gamblers fallacy, it is the mistaken belief that if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future.

For example, if you flip a fair coin and it lands on heads 10 times in a row, the fallacy is believing that the next flip is more likely to be tails to "balance" things out.

In reality, the coin still has a 50% chance of landing on heads or tails, regardless of the previous outcomes.

Have you ever been on a winning streak?

That one time, where you couldn't lose?

Where noth

We've all been there.

Here's one other luck concept: the hot hand fallacy.

The hot hand fallacy is the belief that a person who has experienced success with a random event has a greater chance of further success in additional attempts.

Imagine you're playing basketball and you make three shots in a row. You might start to think you're "on fire" and that you'll definitely make the next shot too.

Or think about playing an arcade game and winning several times in a row. You might believe you're on a winning streak and that you'll keep winning.

Now, imagine you're playing football and you score three goals in a row. You might start to feel invincible and think that you'll score every time you get the ball.

But in reality, each shot or game is independent. Just because you made a few shots or won a few games doesn't mean you're more likely to succeed next time.

It's important to note that the psychological effect of winning can indeed contribute to your chances of winning. Confidence and a positive mindset can improve performance. However, the idea of a "streak" itself is a fallacy. Each attempt remains an independent event, and past successes do not influence future outcomes.

It's like flipping a coin. Even if it lands heads three times in a row, the chance of landing heads or tails on the next flip is still 50/50.

So, the hot hand fallacy is when you think your recent success means you're more likely to keep succeeding, even though each attempt is still just as random as the first.

It originated in basketball, when a player who made several shots in a row was believed to have a "hot hand" and was more likely to make the next shot. However, studies have shown that this belief is not supported by the data.

So, to sum up, the hot hand fallacy is that lucky streaks exist, and despite the fact that they don't actually exist, we like to refer to them as so,

But not to worry, when you're on a winning streak, enjoy it, but remember that each attempt is still just as random as the first.



let's use the coin flip example again.

If you flip a coin and it lands heads 10 times in a row, the hot hand fallacy would be believing that the next flip is more likely to be heads because heads has been landing so frequently.

Appearing to be the opposite of the gambler's fallacy.

One last concept: the law of large numbers.

The law of large numbers states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.

let's use the coin flip example again.

So the next time you see someone flipping a coin to make a decision, 
no it's not strange, it's just probability theory at work.

Thank you, and happy flipping!

// 1 minute summary of speech for intriguing judges for entry into the competition

As you may know, I love using coin flips for many of the decisions I make in life, from choosing subjects to settling arguments, it's my go-to preference for making choices.

I find it fascinating how randomness plays a role in our daily lives, 
It adds an element of excitement and randomness to anything it's integrated with.

I'd like to share with you 3 simple luck theories: the expectancy theory, the Monte Carlo fallacy, and the hot hand fallacy.

In short, the expectancy theory is a predict-the-future formula for games of chance,

the Monte Carlo fallacy is the idea that if something happens more frequently than usual one time, it will happen less frequently in the future.

In short, the hot hand fallacy is the idea that if you're on a winning streak, you're more likely to keep winning.

To sum up, these 3 simple luck theories are just a few examples of how probability theory can be applied to our daily lives, and how randomness can add just that little bit of magic to our everyday decisions.
